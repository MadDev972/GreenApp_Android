    <string name="food_text0">Eating vegetarian/vegan to help the environment</string>
    <string name="food_text1">According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contributes on a "massive scale" to deforestation, air and water pollution, land degradation, loss of topsoil, climate change, the overuse of resources including oil and water, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that "<b>the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global</b>." <b>In 2006, FAO estimated that meat industry contributes 18% of all emissions of greenhouse gases. This figure was revised in 2009 by two World Bank scientists and estimated at 51% minimum.</b>
In a world of diminishing safe water supplies it is worth bearing in mind that animals fed on grain need much more water than grain crops. In tracking food animal production from the feed through to the dinner table, the inefficiencies of meat, milk and egg production range from a 4:1 energy input to protein output ratio up to 54:1.The result is that producing animal-based food is typically much less efficient than the direct harvesting of grains, vegetables, legumes, seeds and fruits for human consumption. A person existing chiefly on animal protein requires 10 times more land to provide adequate food than someone living on vegetable sources of protein.

    <string name="energy_text0"><b>What\'s a carbon footprint?</b></string>
    <string name="energy_text1">A carbon footprint is "the total set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions caused by an organization, event, product or person."It is often expressed in terms of the amount of carbon dioxide, or its equivalent of other GHGs, emitted. 
Calculating your carbon footprint is a good way to get a better grasp on the effects of our everyday life on the atmosphere.

	<string name="Combitech_refchild1">CDP (the Carbon Disclosure Project) is a global climate project that over a third of the Earth\'s total investment capital supports. Its purpose is to facilitate the dialog 
	between investors and companies based on accurate information on the opportunities and threats the company has in relation to climate changes.
	Saab is involved in the project since 2006, and has entrusted Combitech with a big responsibility. Our main task has been to create an overall picture of how the Saab Group is affected
	by climate change and how environmental work is undertaken by the group. For this, Combitech has collected and compiled statistics and other environmental information from business units,
	subsidiaries and suppliers.
	When the CDP ranked Scandinavia\'s 190 largest companies on their awareness of environmental impact in October 2009,
	Saab ended up among the first 20.</string>
	<string name="Combitech_refchild2">Combitech supports SL (Stockholm Transport) in the procurement of contractors 
	for technical maintenance.
	Some of the contracts deal with the setting of environmental standards that are consistent
	with SL\'s high ambitions in the environmental area and which also responds to the law and
	the tough environmental standards that apply to contracts within the city.</string>
	<string name="Combitech_refchild3">In 2008-2009 the Energy Authority maps the vulnerabilities of the Swedish energy system.
	Which parts are vulnerable to the weather?How are these vulnerabilities influenced by climate changes?
	Combitech had several tasks in the project. First, Combitech was in charge with clarifying what had already been investigated, what was 
	being investigated and what remained to investigate in this complex area. For this mission, Combitech analyzed
	large volumes of existing data and produced compilations of the data with the agency and its experts.
	Later in the project Combitech carried out inventories, compared climate forecasts and carried out its own investigations.
	Combitech\'s recommendations were then transmitted for implementation on a municipal, national and private level.</string>
	<string name="Combitech_refchild4">When Saab wanted to explore opportunities to apply their cutting-edge expertise in localization and collaborative systems (Situational Awareness)
	in the environment department, they hired Combitech\'s environment specialists.
	The mission started in 2009 and focused on identifying and analyzing actors, clients, problem areas,
	environment parameters, needs, competing products, information sources, standards etc. The analysis constituted the basis for the development
	of a demonstrator called Environmental Awareness Engine, which was launched autumn 2010. </string>
